So what is this? It's a jQuery workshop that I'm giving (first run at The Rich Web Experience http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/fort_lauderdale/2010/11/home) The goal is simple: get people up to speed on jQuery. Here's the conference blurb:

Sure, Ajax might not be the hardest thing you'll have to do on your current project, but that doesn't mean we can't use a little help here and there. While there are a plethora of excellent choices in the Ajax library space, jQuery is fast becoming one of the most popular. In this talk, we'll see why. In addition to it's outstanding support for CSS selectors, dirt simple DOM manipulation, event handling and animations, jQuery also supports a rich ecosystem of plugins that provide an abundance of top notch widgets. Using various examples, this talk will help you understand what jQuery can do so you can see if it's right for your next project. Once we've established a solid understanding of just what jQuery can do out of the box, we'll delve deeper into the plugin space. jQuery is designed to be extended and while odds are there's a plugin that meets your needs, sometimes only a homegrown solution fits. Starting with a couple of very simple examples, we'll work our way up to more full fledged widgets.

Using a variety of examples and labs, I'll cover:

* Ajax
* CSS selectors and more
* Coding to events and using effects
* Widgets
* Themes
* jQuery Mobile
* Plugins
