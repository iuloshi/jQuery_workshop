* Execute said method in a manner of your choosing

Part 2
* Let’s add another method to jQuery
* Create a method that returns the height of the tallest element on the page
* Math.max(x,y)
* Execute said method in a manner of your choosing

Part 3
* Create a plugin that gives us table hover
* When you mouse over a row, highlight the row - i.e., change the class
* Abstract said code to a separate JS file
